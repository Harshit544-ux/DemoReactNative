This is a new **React Native** project bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli). Follow the steps below to get started with development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Note**: Before you begin, ensure you've completed the official [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### 📦 Step 1: Start Metro Bundler

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. From the root of your project, start it using:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start


📱 Step 2: Run the App
Open a new terminal window and run the app on your desired platform.

Android
bash
Copy
Edit
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android

iOS
For macOS users with Xcode installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
⚠️ If you're running for the first time or after adding native dependencies, make sure to run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ios && pod install

✏️ Step 3: Modify the App
Open the App.tsx file in your editor and start building your application. Changes will automatically reflect thanks to Fast Refresh.
